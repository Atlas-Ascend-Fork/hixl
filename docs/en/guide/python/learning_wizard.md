## Intended Audience

This document guides developers through using Python APIs of the one-sided communication library's LLM-DataDist component for point-to-point data transfers, building disaggregated large-model inference frameworks, and improving throughput of the large-model inference system.

Readers need knowledge in the following areas to better understand this document:

- Basic large-model architectures and concepts
- Familiarity with large-model inference processes
- Ability to develop programs in Python
- Experience running large-model inference with frameworks such as vLLM
