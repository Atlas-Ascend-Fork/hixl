## Intended Audience

This document guides developers through using the one-sided communication library's C++ APIs for inter-cluster data transfers to build disaggregated large-model inference frameworks and improve throughput.

Readers need knowledge in the following areas to better understand this document:

- Basic large-model architectures and concepts
- Familiarity with large-model inference processes
- Ability to develop programs in C++
- Experience running large-model inference with an inference framework
